Project specs:



Game mechanics:
    The player controls a polynomial
    At every time step, currency is gained based on the polynomial characteristics with input X
    The player can upgrade the coeff of the monomials but the degrees are always constant
    the goal is to raise the value of X to reach the final value (can be made 20)
    Player purchases upgrades to imporve coeeficients, X, and other stuff
    Player may buy upgrades to upgrade the GUI (fun)
    May implement alternate currency generation

Needed modules:
    Main: contains the game
        variables: all in a arguments class for easy modification
            time
            X
            polynomial
            currency
            goal conditions
    Polynomial: (wraps everything)
        monomials
        highest degree
        expression
        contribution of each monomials
        upgrades
    Monominals:
        coeff
        degrees
        step
    Upgrades: (contains the upgrades the suer has yet to buy)
        mtd: generate upgrade
        upgrades for each mono is represnted as a list
    Input Parser: (reads user input and returns the action, made to translate to buttons)






Features wanted:
    GUI driven game
    automatic time progression
    compute points and add them
    upgrade systems
    use a mathplotlib plot to represent the progression




Temporary features for testing:
    Console based game 
    X Time advances when the player clicks
    Focus on implementing upgrades
    X make the game function as a command prompt
    Help
    Start at 1 and focus on upgrading smoothly
    Save based on time or manual saving
    Auto loADING SAVE
